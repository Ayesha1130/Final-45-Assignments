//Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11,
// but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a
// message to them. The text of each message should be the same,
// but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.

let names : string [] = ["Hoorain","Ajwa","Aflah","Nabiha"];
let message : string  = "We invite you to our wedding and are hoping that you will come!";
console.log(names[0] +" "+ message);

console.log(names[1] +" "+ message);

console.log(names[2] +" "+ message);

console.log(names[3] +" "+ message)
